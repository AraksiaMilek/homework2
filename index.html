<p>
I'm pretty sure that most of us have encountered annoying individuals throughout our lives. <br/>Some of these individuals are more annoying than others. I am here today to disucss what type of people, I think, make you want to kill them.
</p>

<ul>
<li>people who cut the line in front of you and think that you didn't see them <br/> (very common in universities, don't wanna mention names :P). ughhhhhhh</li>
<li>social justice warriors who get triggered no matter what you say.<br/> I apologize if this point triggered anyone</li>
<li>people who think they are always right and never accept anyone else's observations</li>
<li>people like "qyartus" who have weird principles, and think that women are inferior to men. <br/> I just can't stand people who disrespect women and think that they have more rights than them</li>
<li>close-minded people. very self explanatory</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Summary
</h3>

<p>
These were all the things that i could think of in this short ammount of time. <br/>
Please refrain from being a person who these points apply to.<br/> The world is already a very harsh place, don't add to its misery. thanks and goodbye.
